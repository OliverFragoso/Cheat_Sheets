# Set is a collection of distinct elements this means that can not be duplicates

set_a.difference(set_b) = elements that are present in set_a but not in set_b
set_a.intersection(set_b)
set_a.symmetric_difference(set_b) = elements that exists in exactly one of the sets but not both 
set_a.union(set_b)

element in set_a = membership testing is much faster and efficient
